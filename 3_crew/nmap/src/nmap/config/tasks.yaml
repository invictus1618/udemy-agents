    You will receive the following inputs:

    - open_services: parsed list of open services with port, protocol, service name,
      and optional product/version strings
    - cves_in_output: any CVEs explicitly mentioned by Nmap scripts
    - matched_cves: CVEs inferred from service versions via local mapping rules
    - raw_nmap_output: full text of the raw scan output

    Your job:
    - Summarize the key findings clearly in a concise, actionable way.
    - Provide a detailed vulnerability analysis that explains risk and remediation.
    - Be precise and do not invent CVEsâ€”only use provided CVEs when making claims.
